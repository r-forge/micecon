\section{Conclusion}

The \pkg{micEcon} package provides tools for empirical microeconomic analyses
with some of the most important econometric models in applied microeconomics.
We would like to present these capabilities on the Nordic Econometric Meeting.
Applied economists and econometricians interested in microeconomic modeling
will be invited to join our team and contribute to this package
by providing tools for other types of microeconomic analyses.
