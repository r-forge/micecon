\subsection[Implementation]{Implementation in \pkg{micEcon}}

The estimation of the Heckman selection models are done by maximum
likelihood (ML).  The initial values are calculated by two-step methods,
unless the user prevides the values herself.  

The main frontend for the selection models is the command
\code{selection}.%
\footnote{The command \code{selection} is currently not available
in the released version of the \pkg{micEcon} package,
but it has been added to the development version,
which will be released in the near future.}
It needs a formula for the selection equation, and
one (or a list of two for tobit-5 models) for the outcome equation.
One can choose the method to be either ``ml'' for the ML estimation,
or ``2step'' for two-step results.  If the user does not provide the
initial values for the ML estimate (which is probably almost always
the case), the \code{selection} calculates the consistent initial
values by a two-step estimation.
