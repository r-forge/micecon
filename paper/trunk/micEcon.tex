Since its first public release in 1993, the free open source statistical
language and development environment °\proglang{R}° \citep{r-project}
has been increasingly used for statistical analysis.
While it has been prelevant in many scientific disciplines for a long time,
it was not very widespread in economics in the first years.
However, this situation has changed in recent years.
Consequently, the number of extension packages for \proglang{R}
that are suitable for economists
has strongly increased in the last few years.
One of these packages is called °\pkg{micEcon}° \citep{r-micecon} and provides
tools for microeconomic analysis.

Initially, the \pkg{micEcon} package included only tools
for microeconomic modeling.
For example, it provides functions for demand analysis with the
°Almost Ideal Demand System° (AIDS) \citep{deaton80a}.
These functions enable the econometric estimation,
calculation of demand (price and income/expenditure) elasticities and
checks for theoretical consistency
by one single \proglang{R} command.
Second, \pkg{micEcon} contains tools for production analysis with the
°Symmetric Normalized Quadratic° (SNQ) profit function
\citep{diewert87,diewert92,kohli93}.  
Additionally to the econometric estimation and calculation of price elasticities,
it includes a function that imposes convexity on the
estimated profit function using a new sophisticated method proposed by
\citet{koebel03}.
Third, this package provides a convenient interface to °FRONTIER 4.1°, Tim
Coelli's software for stochastic frontier analysis \citep{coelli96}.
Furthermore, \pkg{micEcon} includes tools for other functional forms, namely 
translog and quadratic functions.

About a year ago, we have added tools for sample selection models
that are also often applied in microeconomic analyses.
The \pkg{micEcon} package now includes functions to estimate these models
using the two-step Heckman or an efficient maximum likelihood procedure.
Furthermore, tools to calculate selectivity terms (°inverse Mill's ratios°)
even from bivariate probit models have been added.

On the useR! conference,
we would like to present the capabilities of the \pkg{micEcon} package.
Applied economists interested in microeconomic modeling will be invited to
join our team and contribute to this package
by providing tools for other types of microeconomic analyses.
