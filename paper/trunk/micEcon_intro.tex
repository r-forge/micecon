\section{Introduction}

Since its first public release in 1993, the free open source statistical
language and development environment °\proglang{R}° \citep{r-project}
has been increasingly used for statistical analysis.
While it has been prevalent in many scientific disciplines for a long time,
it was not very widespread in economics in the first years.
However, this situation has changed in recent years.
Consequently, the number of extension packages for \proglang{R}
that are suitable for economists
has strongly increased in the last few years.
One of these packages is called °\pkg{micEcon}° \citep{r-micecon-0.2-4}
and provides tools for microeconomic analysis.
