\subsection{Stochastic Frontier Models}

Stochastic frontier analysis is a popular tool for production analysis.
It can simultaneously model production technology
as well as possible technical (and allocative) inefficiencies.
\pkg{micEcon} provides a convenient interface to
Tim Coelli's software for stochastic frontier analysis
°FRONTIER 4.1° \citep{coelli96}.
It can be used to write input files for and read output files of °FRONTIER 4.1°.
Hence, the model or the data can be easily modified in \proglang{R}
and the estimation results can be conveniently used
for further analysis.
