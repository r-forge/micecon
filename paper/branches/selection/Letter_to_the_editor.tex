\maketitle

Dear Roger Koenker,

Hereby we send the revised version of our paper ``Sample Selection
Models in R: Package micEcon''.  We appreciate your and the referees'
comments very much.  Below, we briefly describe the changes from
previous version.

Your comments:

\begin{itemize}
\item[4] The Section 5 was retitled to ``Two Replication Excercises''.
\item[5] We changed the title of section 6 to ``Robustness Issues''.
  We also implemented the way of switching maximisation algorithms and
  discussed the non-convergence example in more detail.  We described
  a working workaround, involving more robust maximisation methods.
\end{itemize}

Sincerely,

Arne Henningsen

Ott Toomet
