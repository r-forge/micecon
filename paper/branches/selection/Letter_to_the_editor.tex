\maketitle

Dear Roger Koenker,

Hereby we send the revised version of our paper ``Sample Selection
Models in R: Package micEcon''.  We appreciate your and the referees'
comments very much.  Below, we briefly describe the changes from
previous version.

Your comments:

\begin{itemize}
\item[4] The Section 5 is retitled to ``Two Replication Excercises''.
\item[5] The Section 6 is retitled to ``Robustness Issues''.  We also
  introduced a way to switch maximisation algorithms, and discuss the
  non-convergence example (Section 6.1) in more detail.  We describe a
  usable workaround, involving more robust maximisation methods.
\end{itemize}

First referee's comments:

\begin{itemize}
\item[2] The reference to our package as ``excellent tool'' is removed.
\item[4] Section 5 is retitled, see above.
\end{itemize}

Second referee's comments:

\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

Sincerely,

Arne Henningsen
