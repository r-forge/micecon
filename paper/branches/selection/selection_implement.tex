\section[Implementation]{Implementation in \pkg{micEcon}}

The estimation of the Heckman selection models are done by maximum
likelihood (ML).  The initial values are calculated by two-step methods,
unless the user prevides the values herself.  

The main frontend for the selection models is the command
\code{selection}.  It needs a formula for the selection equation, and
one (or a list of two for tobit-5 models) for the outcome equation.
One can choose the method to be either ``ml'' for the MLf estimation,
or ``2step'' for two-step results.  If the user does not provide the
initial values for the ML estimate (which is probably almoust always
the case), the \code{selection} calculates the consistent initial
values by either \code{heckit2} or \code{heckit5}.  These initial
values are transfer further to the ML estimation function
\code{heckit2fit} or \code{heckit5fit}.
