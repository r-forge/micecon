THIS IS THE CHANGELOG OF THE "micEconSNQP" PACKAGE

Please note that only the most recent and the most significant changes are
reported here. A full ChangeLog is available in the log messages of the SVN
repository on R-Forge.


   CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-8 (2020/02/10)

* removed the output file of the test script (i.e., /tests/snqProfit.Rout.save),
because the test script gives slightly different results on different platforms
but CRAN does not accept deviations between output file in the package and
the results on various platforms.


   CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-6 (2014/04/22)

* 'micEconSNQP' no longer depends on packages 'miscTools", 'systemfit', 'MASS',
and 'micEcon' but it imports packages 'miscTools", 'systemfit', and 'MASS'
and it suggests package 'micEcon'


   CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6-4 (2013/11/06)

* improved documentation of snqProfitEst(), particularly the description of
arguments 'scalingFactors' and 'base'
